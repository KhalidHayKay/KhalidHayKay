# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a web developer passionate about solving problems and creating intuitive, functional solutions. With nearly two years of hands-on experience, I’ve built a variety of personal projects, always eager to explore new technologies and push my limits.

One of my key passions is streamlining frontend with backend, whether it's through my go-to stacks; JavaScript and PHP or integrating other technologies. Ensuring seamless communication between both ends is something I constantly strive to perfect.

I love learning from those ahead of me, blending their insights with my own approach, and taking the time to grasp the full ecosystem of the tools I work with. From HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to frameworks like React and Laravel, I’m committed to mastering my craft.

Feel free to reach out anytime for collaboration or opportunities to work together.
